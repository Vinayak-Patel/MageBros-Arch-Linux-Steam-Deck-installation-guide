## I wanted to play Version 2.0 but it gave me 9 fps on my Windows laptop. So I tried to run it on the Steam Deck and after a few steps, it started working flawlessly!

## So here is a step by step guide to get our favorite childhood game up and running on the Steam Deck.

Step 1: In the Desktop mode, Download the Zip Version on the Steam Deck from the official [Mage Bros Website](http://www.saitogames.com/magebros/).

Step 2: Open Dolphin File Manager and right click on the downloaded zip file (magebros_package.zip) and then Extract it to any folder you want. For example: I extracted it to Home > Games folder.

Step 3: In Dolphin, go to the folder where you extracted the zip file and there in the Mage Bros folder, right click on MageBros.exe and click on Add to Steam.

Step 4: Open the Steam app, locate and click on MageBros.exe in your Steam Library. Click on Settings > Properties > Compatibility. Tick the ‘Force the use of a specific Steam Play compatibility tool’ box and then choose Proton Experimental in the drop down list.

[At this point if you will launch this game through Steam on Gaming mode, then it will run fine. For me it showed a black screen on Desktop mode.

BUT the bad news is that the background music won’t play as Mage Bros uses MIDI files.

To fix this, below is a guide to install and setup a MIDI engine from the Discover store. It was posted for a different game but works perfectly fine for our case as well.]

Step 5: Follow this guide step by step: [Qsynth MIDI engine setup](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2809933598) (Thanks to user Big Trov on Steam for this helpful guide)

Step 6: Now you can launch the game from Gaming mode. A window will pop up after you click on Play and there in the Video Device option, you can choose any option, it doesn’t make any difference. And then click/tap on Start.

Thats it. Enjoy the game on your Steam Deck!
